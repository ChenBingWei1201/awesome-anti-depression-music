# awesome-anti-depression-music
I have severe nose allergies. When I have an allergy attack, I feel irritable, self-doubt, and even have thoughts of not wanting to live anymore. It occupies my time and effort, preventing me from studying. Only music can calm me down. Thus, I want to collect awesome music that tides me through every tough time in this readme and provide sources for those having the same problem.
